            <p>Cancers are a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. If the spread of cancer cells this stage is known as metastasis is not controlled, it can result in death. Cancer is caused by many external factors (tobacco, chemicals, radiation and infectious organisms) as well as some internal factors (inherited mutations, hormones, immune conditions and random mutations). The causes of cancer are diverse, complex and only partially understood. Many things are known to increase the risk of cancer, including dietary factors, certain infections, lack of physical activity, obesity and environmental pollutants. These factors may act together to initiate or promote carcinogenesis in human body and thus cancer is leading cause of death.</p>
            <p>Cancer remains a leading cause of death worldwide with an estimated 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths in 2012, compared with 12.7 million infections, in 2008. Cancer cases worldwide are predicted to increase by 70% over the next two decades, according to the World Health Organization. Cancer mortality is the top killer with breast and cervical cancer as the lead cause. Since the 2008 estimates, breast cancer incidence has increased by more than 20%, while mortality has increased by 14% and is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women in 140 of 184 countries worldwide. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women worldwide, after breast, colorectal, and lung cancers; it is most notable in the lower-resource countries of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

Incidence rates vary by more than 25-fold worldwide, with the highest rates recorded primarily in the developed countries of Oceania, Europe, and North America, largely because of the wide utilization of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing that detects clinically important tumors as well as other slow-growing cancers that might otherwise escape diagnosis. In contrast, males of African descent in the Caribbean region have the highest prostate cancer mortality rates in the world, which is thought to reflect partly difference in genetic susceptibility.</p>

                    <p>NLCs (nanostructured lipid carriers) are tiny particles that can carry drugs. They are made by mixing a solid fat with a liquid fat, which allows them to hold more drug. This means they have a high drug capacity and the drug doesn't get released as easily during storage. NLCs can be used to target cancer cells in the body through a process called the EPR effect.</p>
                    <p>In this case, ATRA (all-trans retinoic acid) is a drug that is used to treat a type of ovarian cancer that doesn't respond well to chemotherapy. ATRA works by controlling the growth and death of cancer cells. However, ATRA has some problems that make it difficult to deliver to the cancer cells. It doesn't dissolve well in water and tends to stick to proteins in the blood. It also has a short half-life, meaning it doesn't stay in the body for long.</p>
                    <p>To overcome these issues, scientists have developed PONC (polymer-oil nanostructured carriers) to deliver ATRA. PONC is made using a method called emulsification-solvent evaporation. PONC particles are small (170-280 nm) and contain ATRA. They have a controlled release of the drug over five days.</p>
                    <p>When tested in a specific type of ovarian cancer cells that are resistant to chemotherapy, ATRA-PONC showed better anticancer effects compared to free ATRA. It was able to enter the cancer cells more easily and release the drug steadily. This resulted in higher levels of cell death and better long-term effects against the cancer.</p>

                    <b>2. Nanocapsules:</b>
                    <p> Nanocapsules are vesicular systems that consist of an oily core covered by a polymeric or lipidic shell. These structures have been exploited for the encapsulation of highly hydrophobic anticancer drugs, such as etoposide, paclitaxel, or docetaxel. Lollo et al. have constructed PGA-PEG nanocapsules for the delivery of docetaxel consisting of an oily core and a polymer shell made of a polyglutamic acid-polyethylene glycol (PEG-PGA) grafted copolymer with 24% w/w PEG content. PGA-PEG nanocapsules were prepared by using modified solvent displacement technique that involved the deposition of the coating polymer onto the oily core mainly by electrostatic interaction. The nanocapsules (200 nm) were negatively charged with 90% encapsulation efficiency. In vivoantitumor activity of docetaxel-loaded PGA-PEG nanocapsules resulted in significant decrease in the tumor growth (p < 0.01) compared to that of Taxotere (docetaxel, Sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC) in mice. Nanocapsules are studied to a limited extent for cancer treatments.</p>

                <div class="info"> <b>3. Chemotherapy wafers:</b>
                <p>Wafer implants are used to treat brain tumors. These wafers are made of a gel-like material that contains a chemotherapy drug. After the brain tumor is surgically removed, several wafers (usually 6 to 8) are placed along the area where the tumor was remove</p>
                <p>Over the course of a few days, the wafers slowly release the chemotherapy drug into the surrounding brain tissue. This release happens gradually over 2 to 3 weeks, with the highest amount of drug being released in the first week. The drug concentration reaches levels of 0.5 to 3.5 mM in the local area.</p>
                <p>Currently, these wafers are approved for use in people with high-grade malignant glioma or glioblastoma multiforme that has returned after previous treatment. The Gliadel® Wafer is one of the most well-studied and successful types of these drug delivery implants for recurrent brain cancer. It was developed in the 1980s by Langer and Brem.</p>
                <p>The Gliadel® Wafer is a small, dime-sized implant that is made of a biodegradable material called polyanhydride. It contains the chemotherapy drug carmustine. The material is dissolved in an organic solvent along with carmustine, and then it is transformed into microparticles through a process called spray-drying. These microparticles are then compressed into wafers that are 14 mm in diameter and 1 mm thick.</p>
                <p>The wafers are rigid at first, but they gradually degrade in two steps. First, water enters the wafers and breaks down the chemical bonds. This process happens during the first 10 hours. Then, the copolymer material starts to erode and dissolve in the surrounding environment, which is mostly water. This allows the drug to be released gradually.</p>
                <p>Researchers have studied the growth pattern of tumor recurrence in patients who were treated with Gliadel® Wafers. They found that nearly 80% of the recurrent tumors were localized or spread within a short distance. Adequate levels of carmustine were detected up to 1 cm away from the surgical resection boundary, indicating that the drug was effectively delivered. The improved survival rates of patients who received both local treatment with Gliadel® Wafers and systemic adjuvant treatment with temozolomide (TMZ) support the use of local therapy to bridge the treatment gap after surgery.</p>

                <div class="info"><b>4. miRNA therapy:</b>
                    <p>MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small RNA molecules (19-25 nucleotides) and encoded in genomes of plants, animals, fungi and viruses. miRNAs are a highly conserved class of naturally occurring non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules, which function as post-transcriptional negative gene regulators of complementary target mRNAs. Although they may differ in distinct organisms, the basic process involves a transcription of  RNA that is processed into shorter units that mediate target recognition in a sequence-specific manner. <br><br> It is reported that around 74% and 92% of the gene transcripts are probably under control of miRNA. miRNAs play a crucial role in normal biological processes, such as cellular differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis through a complicated gene regulation networking. miRNAs control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level, either by degrading or blocking translation of messenger RNA target. <br><br> Amplification or over expression of miRNAs can down-regulate tumor suppressors or other genes involved in cell differentiation, thereby contributing to tumor formation by stimulating proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion; i.e., they act as oncogenes. Similarly, miRNAs can down-regulate different proteins with oncogenic activity; i.e., they act as tumor suppressors.<br><br> In addition, it is now clear that each type of tissues present proper miRNAs expression levels; similarly, each tumor sub-/type presents a unique ‘‘miRNAs signature’’. This specificity explains the differences among cancer sub-/types, as well as primary and metastatic tumors.</p>

                    <p>SRT is highly targeted specific treatment used to treat a variety of brain lesions, using traditional fractionations such as 60 Gy in 30 fractions. SRT is often administered using frame technique, although frameless techniques are also available. SRT can be delivered using several different machines such standard linear accelerators, which use multiple beams from different angles centred on the tumor, and the Gamma Knife, which is designed exclusively to treat intracranial lesions by surgical operations. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR), also known as stereotactic body radiotherapy, involves precise irradiation of extracranial lesions. It is now increasingly used in the treatments of lung, prostate, liver, and pancreatic lesions. It can be delivered using a standard linear accelerator, equipped for image guided IMRT. For mobile lesions tracking or gating technology is used.
                    The CyberKnife is a frameless robotic system consisting of a linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm. It delivers treatment with high accuracy and uses real time image guidance to track the tumor. To allow this, most tumors require implantation of metal markers leading to complications such as pneumothorax in case of lung cancers, but newer software is now being developed that can track some peripheral tumors without markers.</p>
